\chapter{Data sources}\label{data_sources}
In this chapter we describe the PrimeKG knowledge graph\cite{ChandakPayal2023Bakg}, which we have used as the biomedical knowledge source in this work. Secondly, in Section~\ref{data_sources:patient_data}, we introduce the patient data chosen to train and evaluate the developed predictive models.

\section{Knowledge graphs}


\subsection{PrimeKG}\label{data_sources:primekg}

PrimeKG is a multimodal non directed knowledge graph for precision medicine analyses~\cite{ChandakPayal2023Bakg}\footnote{PrimeKG code is available at \url{https://github.com/mims-harvard/PrimeKG}}. It integrates 20 high-quality resources to describe \numprint{17080} diseases with 4.050.249 relationships representing ten major biological scales, including disease-associated protein perturbations, biological processes and pathways, anatomical and phenotypic scales, and the entire range of approved drugs with their therapeutic action, considerably expanding previous efforts in disease-rooted knowledge graphs. PrimeKG contains an abundance of ‘indications’, ‘contradictions’, and ‘off-label use’ drug-disease edges that lack in other knowledge graphs and can support AI analyses of how drugs affect disease-associated networks. 
The \numprint{129375} nodes are subdivided according to the 10 different node types as shown in Table~\ref{tab:primekg_node_types}. 
\input{figs/tabPrimeKGNodes.tex}

The knowledge graph contains \numprint{4050249} edges, which type depends on the nodes they connect. The relations between nodes are enriched by edge types \textsl{indication} and \textsl{contraindication} that are incident in drug and disease nodes, and \textsl{off-label use} that connect drug and disease nodes. In Figure~\ref{fig:primekg_edge_types_hypergraph} we show a hypergraph representing the edge types in PrimeKG and how they are related. The nodes CC, BP, and MF represent types \textsl{cellular component}, \textsl{biological process}, and \textsl{molecular function}, respectively.

\end{figure}
To better understand the distribution of the edge types in PrimeKG, Figure~\ref{fig:primekg_edge_types_hypergraph_perc} illustrates the number of edges for each edge type by weighing the connections in the hypergraph according to their percentage in PrimeKG. Also, the directed hypergraph in Figure~\ref{fig:primekg_edge_types_hypergraph_perc_on_type} shows for each edge type the percentage of connections to the other edge types.
