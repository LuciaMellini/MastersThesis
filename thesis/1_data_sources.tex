\chapter{Data sources}\label{data_sources}
In this chapter we describe the actual data on which we have applied and evaluated the methods presented in the last chapter. Firstly, in Section~\ref{data_sources:primekg}, we introduce the chosen knowledge graph, which we have used as the biomedical knowledge source in this work. Secondly, in Section~\ref{data_sources:patient_data}, we introduce the patient data contained in the GA4GH Phenopackets.
